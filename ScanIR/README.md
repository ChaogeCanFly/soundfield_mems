#ScanIR

ScanIR was developed by Braxton Boren and Agnieszka Roginska at NYU. For our research we made use of the software and added a few functions that we thought were useful.

The software depends on PsychToolbox (specifically audio related folder) - this is for interfacing with audio hardware

and, in our case, it also requires the Arduino Library for Matlab since this allows us to connect to our stepper motor.

We are working on expanding ScanIR to allow for FOA polar plots, frequency response plots and single channel polar plots.

We also wish it to be modular so people with other motors can make use of it, not just those who have the exact same motor as us.
