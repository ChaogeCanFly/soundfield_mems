# Soundfield MEMS Tetra Mic

This is a repository housing all things related to the slick new soundfield MEMS mic created in collaboration with NYU postdoc (Charlie Mydlarz) and graduate students from the MTech program. We are designing a first order ambisonics mic who's: enclosure will be 3D printed, electronics will be hand soldered and circuit boards will be designed with Eagle. 

We hope to make this project open source so that anyone who wants to experiment with ambisonics can print and build the mic themselves.

The encoder and decoder will also be included and will run on Matlab or Octave GNU.
