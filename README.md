# MEMS Sound-field FOA Mic

This is a repository housing all things related to the slick new soundfield MEMS mic created in collaboration with NYU postdoc [Charlie Mydlarz](http://cusp.nyu.edu/people/charlie-mydlarz/) and graduate students from NYU's [MTech program](http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/music/technology). We are designing a first order ambisonics mic with an enclosure entirely 3D printed, hand soldered and reflowed electronics, and custom circuit boards designed in [Eagle](http://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview). The boards can also be designed in KiCad (an open source solution if anyone is looking for one).

We are making this project open source so that anyone who wants to experiment with ambisonics can print and build the mic themselves. The encoder and decoder will also be included and should run on [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab) or [Octave GNU](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave). Let us know if there are any issue running on Octave, we have not tested this yet!

## Documentation

Documentation will be included to describe how to build your own MEMS Ambisonic Mic, how to encode and decode the audio based on your speaker configuration and what the whole point of building one of these is.

## Task list

- Include documentation about how the MEMS capsules work, what ambisonics is and some general principles of psychoacoustics and audio that make this all worth it.
