#Computer Assisted Designs

Out first design was made on SolidWorks by Yigal Kamel and Gabriel Zalles

Since then we have been making small changes on it using TinkerCad due to it's simplicity and robustness.

Feel free to download these files and print them yourself or send them to Shapeways.

A note of caution, the quality of the print will affect your ability to fit the PCBs inside the mic mounts.

For the smaller design we used the Form2 at NYU's Makerspace with Clear material.
